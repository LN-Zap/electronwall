# ‚ö°Ô∏èüõ° electronwall
A tiny firewall for LND that can filter Lightning **channel opening requests** and **HTLC forwards** on your node based on set rules. electronwall runs in the background and either allows (allowlist) or rejects (denylist) events from a list of node public keys for channel openings, or channel IDs and channel pairs for payment routings.
